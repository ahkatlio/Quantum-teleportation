# Quantum-teleportation
Quantum teleportation is a process in which the state of a quantum system is transferred from one location to another without the state being directly measured or transferred through a physical medium. 
In Qiskit, it can be simulated using the Quantum Circuit and Quantum Register classes, as well as the measurement and control operations.
